# Now with Maven!

This version of the project Wakayama now comes with Maven-support.

- you can add now the project to IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ
as an Maven project
- external libraries or dependencies are now handled by the pom.xml!

**This makes the integration of the project much more enjoyable!**

Have fun my fellow students.
